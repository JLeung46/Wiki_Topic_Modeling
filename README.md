# Wiki_Topic_Modeling

### Introduction
With the massive amount of information being stored in books, blogs, scientific papers and other forms of social media, it's becoming increasingly difficult and time consuming to find exactly what we're looking for. Topic Modeling serves as a method to uncover hidden themes in a collection of documents. It can be applied to a massive amount of data and allows us to browse, search and summarize text in new, more efficient ways!

This project utilizes Spark on AWS and the K-Means algorithm to cluster Wikipedia Articles and discover latent topics. NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, stop word removeal and term frequency weighting are used as pre-processing steps on the raw text.

The dataset used contains 15M articles on Wikipedia.

### In Progress

Find optimal clusters using elbow method and visualize results combined with an analysis.

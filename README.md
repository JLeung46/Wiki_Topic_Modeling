# Wiki_Topic_Modeling
This project serves as an introduction to Spark on AWS. It utilizes the K-Means algorithm to cluster Wikipedia Articles and predict the topic of a new article. Standard NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming and term frequency weighting are used as pre-processing steps on the raw text.

The dataset used contains a random 10% sample of all articles on Wikipedia.
